## Multiple Components

Any nontrivial Angular application will be composed of many components.
Components are the primary chunk out of which an application is
constructed, so it's very important to become comfortable composing them
together.

### Using inspector tooling to understand the component hierarchy

As your application has more and more components, understanding how
they are nested together can grow more difficult. To help with that
problem and assist with many other areas of analysis and debugging,
consider the Augury plug-in for Chrome.

Augury was created by a group of developers at Rangle, as a follow-on
to the older Batarang development assistance tool for AngularJS 1.x.
